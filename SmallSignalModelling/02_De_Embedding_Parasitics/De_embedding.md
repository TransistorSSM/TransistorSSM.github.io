# De-Embedding Parasitics

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
<div style="font-size:13pt;">
Removing or de-embedding the effect of parasitic components of the SSM is an important step for the extraction of intrinsic parameters. Below we describe the typical de-embedding procedure found in papers, textbooks and Ph.D. thesis as well as  how the $\textbf{ssm}$ module can be used to de-embed parasitic from measured $S-$parameters, examples and plots are shown and discussed. 
</div>

<div style="font-size:13pt;">
Fig. 4. A 16-element SSM (a) and 20-element SSM (b). The 20-element small signal model includes additional parasitic capacitances generated by the gate-source ($C_{pgi}$), drain-source ($C_{pdi}$) and gate-drain ($C_{gdi}$) metals as well as the stray capacitance $C_{pgd}$ generated by the gate and drain RF pads. 
</div>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
<div style="font-size:13pt;">
Fig. 4 shows the 16-element and 20-element small signal models, respectively. The 20-element model includes aditional parasitic capacitances generated between the gate, drain and source fingers. The parasitics  $C_{pdi}$, $C_{gdi}$ are typically small and neglected in most SSM [1]; this affects intrinsic $C_{gd}$ which will be overestimated by an equivalent amount, however, this will not affect the overal match between the model and measured $S-$parematers.
The de-embedding procedure for removing the parasitics is similar irrespective of the complexity of the SSM. The procedure is described by the following schematic:

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
<div style="font-size:13pt;">
Once the parasitics have been removed we get access to the intrinsic device. Working with $Y-$parameters of the intrinsic model is easier due to $\pi$-topology of the model and the presence of the voltage controlled current source. The $Y_{int}$ is described in terms of device parameters in "Instrinsic Models and Papameter Extraction"(create a link to section).

If the more complex 20-element model is used then $Y_{pc}$ has to be modified to include the device-finger parasitics as:
</div>
<div style="font-size:14pt;">    
'$
Y_{pc} = j\omega
\begin{bmatrix}
 (C_{pg} + C_{pgi}) &  ( C_{pgd} + C_{gdi} ) \\
( C_{pgd} + C_{gdi} ) &  (C_{pd} + C_{pdi})
\end{bmatrix}
$'

        
</div>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
<div style="font-size:13pt;">
The effect of de-embeding the parasitics on $S-$parameters will be ilustrated with the following example.    
</div>


```python
import numpy as np
import skrf as rf              # Import scikit rf module, we need this to import the measured S-pars     
import ssm_models as ssm       # This module will allows as to get the de-embedded  Y and S-parameters 
                               # in a scikit rf Network() format.
    
import Sparameter_plots as plts  # This module will allow us to make plots and compare them easily 
                                 #(check Plotting with SSM module for mode details)
    
import os                      # this will be used to get the file names, in specified folders, automatically 
from   pathlib import Path     # adding this only for development, should be removed in the final version 
home      = str(Path.home())   # this is a convinent if multiple people share the same folder, should be removed in final version

# Define file location for S-parameter Data
fl_loc    = fr"{home}\Box\SSM_Summer2023\For_githab_descriptions\De-Embedding\data"
# Import the file names in fl_loc 
fl_nms    = os.listdir(fl_loc)
# Create a file path for the above file names
fl_pth    = [fl_loc + fr"\{x}" for x in fl_nms]

```

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
<div style="font-size:13pt;">
We can now import the $S-$ parameter data in a scikit- rf Network format.
</div>


```python
ntw_ms    = [rf.Network(x) for x in fl_pth] 
```


```python
ntw_ms   # check our network. Below you can see details about the S-aprameter measurements.
```

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
<div style="font-size:13pt;">
In order to remove the parasitics from the above $S-$parameters we first have to define the parasitic $Y_{pc}$ and $Z_{p}$ matrices. This can be easily done with the $\textbf{ssm}$ module and its subclasses $pZ$ and $pY$, as we will show below but first lets define the parasitics:
</div>


```python
############################# Note : some of these values were extracted following procedure described 
#############################        in parasitic capacitance, inductances and resistances.
cpg       = 18.5e-15   # F
cpd       = 14.6e-15   # F
lg        = 35.5e-12   # H
ls        = 2.5e-12    # H
ld        = 37.5e-12   # H
rg        = 1.22       # Ohm
rs        = 0.8        # Ohm
rd        = 1          # Ohm

caps      = [cpg,   cpd]  # define a list for each of the parasitic cpacitances, inductances and resistances
inds      = [lg, ld, ls]
res       = [rg, rd, rs]

# define frequency, we need this for the parasitic Y and Z matrices
freq      = ntw_ms[0].f   # Hz # this allows the extraction of frequencies directly from measured S-parameter touchstone files.
                               # alternatively, you can create a numpy array with the frequency point manually.
```

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
<div style="font-size:13pt;">
The parasitic $Y_{pc}$ and $Z_{p}$ can be defined through  $pY$ and $pZ$, respectively. 
</div>


```python
Ypc       = ssm.pY(caps, freq)
# and 
Zp        = ssm.pZ(inds, res, freq)

## We can easily gain acess to individual Y or Z parameters
## for example if we want Y11 we can simple call Ypc.Y11() this will give
## all frequency points of Y11, to save space will call ony the first 10 points
Ypc.Y11()[:10]   
## You can repeat the above for the rest of the Y-parameters as Ypc.Y12(), Ypc.Y21() and Ypc.Y22()
```

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
<div style="font-size:13pt;">
We can now de-embed the parasitics following the procedure described previously. For simplicity, this can be done automatically with the $iY$ class of the $\textbf{ssm}$  module.
</div>


```python
#intrinsic Y-parameters class
y       = ssm.iY(caps, inds, res, ntw_ms)     # iY takes all the parasitics and the data from which we want to 
                                              # remove the parasitics, then it automatically performs steps 1-7
                                              # of the de-embedding procedure. Randomly chose the last dataset from ntw_ms
        
# to get the instrinsic Y-parameters just call yi()
Intrinsic_Yparameters = y.yi()
# The above will give you (#data_sets, #frequency_points, 2,2) as you can verify with Intrinsic_Yparameters.shape
# You can get-the individual Y-parameters by calling the equivalent individual Y-parameter, Y11 for example would be
# y.y11() , below will print only the first 10 points:
y.y11()[0][:10]     # [0] to grab the 1st data-set in the list, and [:10] to show just the 10 first 10 points
```

```


```python
# we can plot the de-embedded and S-parameters and measured S-parameters using Sparameter_plots.
plot   = plts.Plot([ntwi[0], ntw_ms[0]], name=['de-embedded', 'measured']) # passing in a list of networks and a list of labels
plot.db.s()                                                                # for the data

In the above plot we can observe the effect of de-embedding parasitics on the $S-$ parameters. 
We observe that $s_{21}$ increased in magnitude at all frequencies, this can be attributed to parasitics $R_{s}$ and $R_{d}$.
The effect of these resistances are more pronounced at lower frequencies ($\sim 1$ GHz or lower), while the higher frequency dependece is affected by parasitic $C_{pg}$ (and $C_{pgi}$ if included in $Y_{pc}$). The differences in $s_{11}$ and $s_{22}$ are attributed to the removal of the input and output parasitics.

A brief description of the de-embedding procedure can be found in almost all papers on small signal modelling. A good introduction can be found in [1],[2] and [3],[4],[5].
